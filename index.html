    <h2>Story Time</h2>
    <p>
      I find it fascinating that I am part of the last generation to have lived in a world untouched by AI.
      There’s something nostalgic about remembering a time when technology felt more like a companion than
      an architect of our daily lives. My earliest memories of computers take me back to a bulky gray machine,
      its screen glowing with that iconic pinball game—one I’m sure many from my generation were equally obsessed with.
      And, of course, who could forget that incredibly distinguished dial-up noise, the sound of patience itself
      as we waited to connect to the internet?
    </p>
    <p>
      Technology has always been a presence in my life, evolving alongside me like an old friend. My first phone was a
      Sidekick,
      though I secretly preferred sneaking my sister’s pink Razr just to play that classic snake game.
      I still remember the pure excitement of owning my first touchscreen phone—an Android I cherished like a treasure.
      And my first iPod? A reminder of a time when we carried separate devices for everything. It’s funny to think how
      far we’ve come.
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking back, I realize these experiences were the foundation of my love for digital media.
      I have always been a creative soul, once dreaming of becoming the next Leonardo da Vinci (though, let’s be real,
      that was a bit ambitious).
      But in pursuing art, I stumbled upon something even more profound—a bridge between technology and design, one that
      allows me to create
      experiences that truly connect with people.
    </p>
    <p>
      For me, crafting beautiful, intuitive, and human-centered digital experiences will be my Mona Lisa—a legacy of
      creativity,
      innovation, and heart in an ever-evolving digital world.
